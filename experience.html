    <h3>Data Strategy Lead</h3>
    <br>
    As a Data Strategy Lead, I played a vital role in driving the successful implementation of the Apptio - IT Cost Transparency initiative for American International Group (AIG). This new project, entrusted to TCS in August 2016, aimed to transform data processing and provide accurate IT cost insights to key stakeholders. In this capacity, I led the formulation of data strategies, collaborated with stakeholders, and streamlined processes to achieve exceptional results. Here are the key highlights of my contributions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Collaborated with the customer to transform business data requirements for the IT Cost Transparency module in TBMS.
      </li>
      <li>
        Acted as a liaison between IT and Corporate Finance, addressing analytics queries and removing financial roadblocks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Streamlined data processing and established data transparency through the creation of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for over 100 data sets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Utilized APIs and custom functions in Apptio to streamline the month-end close process for the Bill of IT, resulting in a 40% reduction in processing time (from 5 weeks to 3 weeks).
      </li>
      <li>
        Facilitated accessibility, consistency, and a transparent overview of data sets for the team and data users.
      </li>
      <li>
        Played a pivotal role in enhancing operational efficiency and providing timely, accurate IT cost data to key stakeholders, including the CIO and CFO.
      </li>
      <li>
        Coordinated with customers to review monthly billing worth $6M+ and efficiently processed invoices in SAP Fieldglass.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prioritized team activities to achieve and maintain a highly productive workforce in a deadline-driven environment
      </li>
    </ul>
