    <h3>IT Financial Analyst</h3>
    <h4>September, 2011 to July, 2016</h4>
    <br>
    As an IT Financial Analyst at Tata Consultancy Services, I held a pivotal role in managing and optimizing various financial aspects of IT projects. With expertise in resource allocation, timesheet tracking, billing, and revenue forecasting, I made significant contributions to the success and profitability of the organization. Here are the key highlights of my contributions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        I oversaw the operations of the IT Project Management Office (PMO), handling projects valued at $5 million or more and managing an account of 400+ full-time employees. In this capacity, I collaborated closely with Business Relationship Managers to ensure effective project planning and execution.
      </li>
      <li>
        One of my key responsibilities was to monitor and track actual revenue numbers against the budgeted amount. By diligently analyzing and comparing these figures, I identified potential risks and variances and developed robust mitigation plans to address them. This proactive approach allowed for better financial control and ensured that projects stayed within the allocated budget.
      </li>
      <li>
        Additionally, I focused on assessing and minimizing billing leakage, a crucial area that directly impacted profitability. Through detailed analysis and process improvements, I successfully reduced billing leakage trends, resulting in a consistent 2% increase in profitability every quarter. This achievement not only enhanced financial performance but also strengthened client relationships by ensuring accurate and transparent billing practices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Furthermore, I played a vital role in revenue forecasting, leveraging financial and operational data to develop accurate projections. By considering factors such as project pipelines, resource utilization rates, and contractual terms, I provided valuable insights for business planning and decision-making. These forecasts contributed to effective resource allocation, improved financial planning, and overall organizational success.
      </li>
      Throughout my tenure as an IT Financial Analyst, I consistently demonstrated strong analytical skills, attention to detail, and the ability to collaborate with cross-functional teams. By effectively managing resources, tracking timesheets, optimizing billing processes, and providing accurate revenue forecasts, I significantly contributed to the financial health and profitability of Tata Consultancy Services.
